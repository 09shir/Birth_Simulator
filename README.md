# Birth Simulator

![FOTP](./doge.ico)

If you were to reborn, which country would you be born at?

The project calculates chances of giving birth at each country using countries' total population and birthrate. It includes a world map from Mapbox API and functions like a real map, for instance allowing users to zoom in for close map details.
